# Exercice 1 : Define the requirements

You were asked to participate in a project to deploy a new solution in a public cloud of your choice. This hands-on assignment is the first step in that process.

Use one of your existing projects, or something one of your customers is working on, or one of the sample projects described at the bottom of this document and document the requirements:

1. What services should the public cloud deployment offer to the customers?
2. How will the users consume those services? Will they use Internet access or will you have to provide a more dedicated connectivity solution?
3. Identify the data needed by the solution you're deploying. What data is shared with other applications? Where will the data reside?
4. What are the security requirements of your application?
5. What are the high availability requirements?
6. Do you have to provide connectivity to your on-premises data center? If so, how will you implement it?
7. Do you have to implement connectivity to other (customer) sites? If so, how will you implement it?
