# Exercice 2 : Your First Infrastructure-as-Code Deployment

After creating an account with a public cloud provider and selecting IaC tool, you have to: 
1. create a single public cloud resource using infrastructure-as-code tool of your choice.
	- You could do something as simple as creating a tenant network (VPC/Vnet) with RFC 1918 prefix
    - or deploy a virtual machine. 
	
2. After you managed to create the selected public cloud resource change the definition file to rename it, change its parameters, or remove it.
